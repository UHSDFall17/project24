Gary: on 9/19 I create a basic initialization class for the task feature. Obj can be created by calling on this class. New functions are ready to be added to this class.

Gary: on 10/8 I create 
1) a connection to the Oracle local db from the java program
2) java sql execute function 
3) java sql auto id generation by calling max(id) from the db 
4) task_comment relational tables in the db 
So now it is supported for user to create new task and comment and submit them to the db
